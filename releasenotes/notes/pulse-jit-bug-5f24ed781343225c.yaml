    Fixes a bug in the automatic jit-compilation of :meth:`Solver.solve` when using
    the `t_eval` kwarg with a JAX method and `Array.default_backend() == 'jax'`.
    The bug is fixed by updating the time-argument handling for the cases
    `method='jax_odeint'` or `method` being a Diffrax method. The automatic jitting is
    disabled for all other JAX methods.
